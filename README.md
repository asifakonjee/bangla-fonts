# Fonts

This fonts directory contains some of my preferred fonts for GNU/Linux Distros. This folder contains common ms fonts and some common bangla fonts.

Copy the fonts from fonts folder in the ~/.local/share/fonts directory and run the following command to install fonts
```
sudo fc-cache -fv
```
